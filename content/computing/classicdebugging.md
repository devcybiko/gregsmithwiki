# Classic Debugging Tips

1. Computers don't lie.
	2. If it says something's broken - it's broken
2. If you keep getting the same error despite the fact that you made a change,  make sure you're editing the same time
3. Print out values
4. Print out data types of values
5. Insert a debug line at the start and end of a function
6. Insert an obviously wrong line of code - maybe we're not even getting here.
7. Browsers
	1. Always run with the Debugger and with Network/Disable-Caching
8. Make sure the HTML ids match the JQuery ID
9. Give the computer what it wants
	8. File not found? Give it the file.
	9. NaN? - Find out what value is not a number and give it a number.
	10. Division by zero? - find out what variable is zero and give it a value.
10. If something suddenly stops working - what changed?
	1. Always look at the acute errors 
11. Stay focused - fix one thing at a time.
12. 2. If you keep getting the same error despite the fact that you made a change,  make sure you're editing the same time
13. If the 'cycle time' between a change and seeing it on-screen is really long, Consider breaking the problem out into a smaller sample piece of code and debugging that instead.
14. If you keep getting the same errror despite the fact that you made a change - make sure you saved the file.
15. If you keep getting the same errror despite the fact that you made a change - make sure you edited the right file - in the right folder.
16. FOr code that is taking a long time to run, consider returning a static value at the top of the function that is slow during the testing.
17. Challenge your Assumptions
	1. Are you sure the value you're passing was received?
	19. Are you in the right folder?
	20.
