# Starting an App - Fry an Onion

When I was in college I had a girlfriend who cooked every night for dinner. She never knew what she was going to cook. But she would makes something out of whatever we had in the fridge.

To get started, she always peeled an onion and started frying it up. The aroma of frying onion got her creative culinary juices flowing and then she'd start pulling whatever food we had in the fridge out and make something awesome.

## The Software Equivalent of Frying an Onion

Whenver I start a new project, I hate to start from scratch. I usually think about the tech stack I want to use and start pulling them into my 'fridge'.

I also have a few 'template' or 'skeleton' projects lying around that are a leg-up or prototype for what I want to create. I can usually copy them into my workspace and get going. Just like my girlfriend never started with all the ingredients - just an onion, I also start with a skeleton which represents my 'onion.'

Almost always, when I'm creating a web page, I start with the Home page and a NavBar. Once I get that working, I start thinking about the pages I want on my site. This is the 'frying' part of my proverbial onion.

It's my preference to only put 2-3 tabs on the NavBar just to get it going. I don't worry about how beautiful it
