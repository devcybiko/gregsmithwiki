Installation was a nightmare. The patio panel was just too tall even at the shortest setting. I removed the spring-loaded pins that push the top part up and installed it without the top bit. Except that left a small gap at the top. So I jerry-rigged one half of to top bit to act as a slider.

The patio door does not slide into the gap where my sliding glass door would snuggle in. Instead it is "flush" - and that is apparently by design. I'll have to put foam insulation there (not included).

The directions for using the T-brackets were vague at best. I had to guess at how to use them.

The sliding glass door does not meet flush against the patio panel. So, I will need more foam insulation (not included). And the lock they supply is a joke. I would have preferred if my old patio door would marry with the patio panel and use the old lock that is part of the door. There's no good reason that it cannot except the patio panel is too thick.

Overall this is a huge disappointment. I paid $150 and expected much better quality. Plus, the door is super white and doesn't match anything in my home - so I'll have to paint it as well.

I don't understand the need for the door sweep. I didn't need one before the patio panel - so why do I need one now? Maybe because the Patio Panel doesn't marry on either side of the panel with the existing door materials.

Overall this was a huge disappointment. The good news is that my dog loves it. OH ONE MORE THING... my dog weighs 50 lbs and just barely makes her way through the opening. This door is rated for dogs up to 100lbs. NO WAY CAN A 100 LB DO FIT THROUGH THIS DOOR. If my dog gains 10 lbs she won't fit. BUY THE BIGGEST DOOR YOU CAN AFFORD.
