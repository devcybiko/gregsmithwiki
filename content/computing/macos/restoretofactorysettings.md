# Restore Mac to Factory Settings

From : [https://mackeeper.com/blog/post/473-step-by-step-guide-to-reset-mac-to-factory-settings/](https://mackeeper.com/blog/post/473-step-by-step-guide-to-reset-mac-to-factory-settings/)

## Restart in Recovery Mode
You’re going to erase your startup disk, so the first thing you need to do is start up from the recovery partition. To do this, click  and choose  _Restart_. When your Mac shuts off and then powers back on, press and hold  _Command+R_  keys until you see the Apple logo. Then release the keys and proceed to the next step.

## Erase Data from Mac Hard Drive

While in Recovery Mode, you won’t see your usual login screen. Instead, you’ll see the  **“macOS Utilities”**  window. Here are your next steps:

**a.**  In the  _macOS Utilitie_s window, choose  _Disk Utility_  and click  _Continue_.

**b.**  Choose your startup disk and click  _Erase_.

**c.**  Choose  _Mac OS Extended (Journaled)_  as the format.

**d.**  Click  _Erase_.

**e.** Wait until the process is finished. When it’s done, go to the  _Disk Utility_  menu at the top and quit  _Disk Utility_.

## Reinstall macOS (optional)

Now, with your hard drive completely erased and free of any data, you can perform a clean install of macOS. You can do so while your Mac is still in recovery mode. From the same  _macOS Utilities_  window, choose  _Reinstall macOS_  (_Reinstall OS X_  in older versions). Consider installing a  [new macOS Catalina](https://mackeeper.com/blog/post/631-macos-catalina-public-beta).

But doing so isn’t necessary. If you’re giving your Mac to someone else to enjoy, you may just leave it as is so that the new owner can set it up as they like.

You’re done. Your Mac is fully prepared for its new owner. Don’t forget, you can use these instructions if you’re selling your Mac or if you want to erase your startup disk to reinstall macOS.
