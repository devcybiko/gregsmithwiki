# Classic Computing Problems

1. Editing one file, and running with another
2. Indentation / Scope - putting a line-o-code outside the loop
3. Files in the wrong folder / directory
4. Dirty Data
5. Be consistent in the naming of your variables
	1. Be sure that variables don't have a misspelling
	2. Use Copy/Paste rather than fat-fingering your variable names
	3. IF you have a global variable, make sure you 'global' define it. And make sure the global variable name is correctly spelled everywhere
