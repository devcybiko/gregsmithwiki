# Linux Commands

# The Terminal
## Speedy Typing in the Terminal
1. Use the `up arrow` key to scroll backwards to previous commands
2. Use the `down arrow` key to scroll forward through commands
3. Use the `left-arrow` and `right arrow` keys to position your cursor within the command and edit it
4. Use the `Backspace/Delete` keys to delete letters
5. Type in the middle of the command to insert new letters
6. NOTE: You can hit the `ENTER` key at any time (not just at the end of the line)
	1. So, you cursor-left, edit, and hit `ENTER` in the middle of the command and it will submit it
	2. You don't have to cursor all the way to the right before you hit ENTER
7. Use the `TAB` key to `autocomplete` file names
	6. Enter the first few letters of the file name and hit `TAB` and the Terminal will type the rest
	7. If you hear a `bell` and you don't see the completed filename, it's because there is more than one completions
	8. Hit the `TAB` key twice and you'll see a list of possible completions
	9. Continue typing characters and hit `TAB` again
8. In case that wasn't clear: Hitting `TAB`+`TAB` (hitting `TAB` twice) shows a list of files

# Command Format
## Spaces as separators
## Return Codes

# Filenames
## Upper/Lowercase)
## Watch out for spaces/special chars
## Filename Extensions (conventions)
- Usually 3 or fewer characters
- Modern extensions can get LONG (.html, .json, 
* .txt - text
* .py - python
* .html
* .css
* .js
* .c
* .o
* .a
## Hidden Files (dot files)
## Filename Globbing


# Directories (Folders)
## Hierarchical / Tree Structure
## Slash (forward slash) Separator
## Special notes
* MacOS - colon (`:`) is problematic
* Windows - Backslash is problematic 
  - it's the DOS standard 
  - But in gitbash it's forward slash `/`
  - But in Linux, Backslash is the 'escape' character
  - Colon is problematic - it is the device separator (`C:`)

## Special Directories
* Home `~` (/User/username, /home/username, C:\Users\username)
* Dot / Here `.`
* Parent / Previous / Up `..`
* Root (`/`) - the top-most directory


# Simple Commands

* REMEMBER: Commands have a simple, space-separated format...

    `command` `--optons -opts` `file1` `file2` `file3...`

* Very often you can find out what the 'usage' is with the `--help` option and the current version with the `--version` option.

    `node --help`

    `node --version`

* NOTE: If you need to use special characters (like spaces, slashes, etc...) surround the filename in single quotes:

    `git add 'My First Web Page.html'`
