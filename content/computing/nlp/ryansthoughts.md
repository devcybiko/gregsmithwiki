# Ryan's Thoughts

Here's Ryan's brain dump of things to do for NLP projects. Many of them are available as part of Apache's OpenNLP project. There is a wrapper for Node.js available. I've added (OpenNLP) for things that are already done. I also have my own library of NLP code that tokenizes documents. I've added (GLS) for those.

* Sentence map connecting nouns to verbs. (OpenNLP)
* Sentence map connecting nouns to adjectives. (OpenNLP)
* Code that picks out proper nouns. (OpenNLP)
* Code that can differentiate between proper nouns (person, not person/ place, thing) (Entity extraction) (OpenNLP) (GLS)
* Language swap thesaurus.
* Replace verbs without changing the story.
* Replace adjectives without changing the story
* Associated words algorithm- creating a thesaurus based search engine to connect related and derived words and pull them from book sized word sets.
* Set parameters to define a “hero”
* Set parameters to define all character archetypes
* Teach computer to find common occurrences and patterns for each archetype
* Replace characters from one story and another within archetype. (Gandalf swapped with Obi-Wan)
* Define setting based on setting descriptions.
* Define setting descriptions (time, place, genre)
* Have a computer recognize parts of the hero's journey.
* Have computer create outlines based on parts of the hero’s journey
