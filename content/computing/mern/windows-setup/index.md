# Windows Setup

Set up steps...

1. install [Git for Windows]([https://gitforwindows.org/)

## Git BASH

Git for Windows provides a BASH emulation used to run Git from the command line. *NIX users should feel right at home, as the BASH emulation behaves just like the "git" command in LINUX and UNIX environments.

## _Git GUI_

_As Windows users commonly expect graphical user interfaces, Git for Windows also provides the Git GUI, a powerful alternative to Git BASH, offering a graphical version of just about every Git command line function, as well as comprehensive visual diff tools._

NOTE: This tutorial does not use _Git GUI_. We'll be doing all our `git` interactions using GitBash.

## Shell Integration

Simply right-click on a folder in Windows Explorer to access the BASH or GUI.
