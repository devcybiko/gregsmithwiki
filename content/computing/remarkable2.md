# Remarkable 2 vs. iPad (8th Gen)
## Overview
Disclaimer: I don't work for Remarkable.

I created this web page to compare the Remarkable 2 w/ marker ($448) to iPad 8th Gen w/ Apple Pencil ($429). This is as close to an Apple to non-Apples comparison as I can get. 

I fully believe that Remarkable, Inc. do not do this themselves because they are not trying to lure you away from iPad and a comparison is not fair - they have different purposes. The iPad is a general-purpose computing device. Remarkable 2 is specifically for reading and writing documents and notes. They aren't really supposed to be compared.

But I will show - the Remarkable is point-for-point very similar to the iPad 8 except for the following:

|Differences | Remarkable 2 + Marker | iPad 8th Gen + Apple Pencil |
|---| ---|---|
|Price | $18 more | - |
|Display | grayscale eInk display | color Retina display |
|Battery | 2 weeks on a charge | 10 hrs on a charge |
|Marker | No charging | 12hrs on a charge |
|Marker | No need for connectivity | Bluetooth 4.0 |
|Processor | 1.2 ghz 2-core ARM | 2.4ghz 4-core Bionic |
|RAM | 1GB | 8GB |
|Storage | 8 GB | 32 GB |

note: iPad requires significantly more processor and memory to drive its OS and Color display
note: iPad requires significantly more storage to store its larger OS, and many Apps

## Conclusions

If you're in the market for a note-taking device that is close to paper, Remarkable 2 is point-for-point on target with an iPad 8. But if you want a general purpose computer, you really should not be looking at Remarkable 2.
