# Linux Command Cheat Sheet 

* REMEMBER: Commands have a simple, space-separated format...

    `command` `-options` `file1` `file2` `file3...`

* Very often you can find out what the 'usage' is with the `--help` option and the current version with the `--version` option.

    `node --help`

    `node --version`

* NOTE: If you need to use special characters (like spaces, slashes, etc...) surround the filename in single quotes:

    `git add 'My First Web Page.html'`
