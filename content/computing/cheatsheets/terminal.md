# Get to Know Your Terminal

## Speedy Typing in the Terminal

1. Use the `up arrow` key to scroll backwards to previous commands
2. Use the `down arrow` key to scroll forward through commands
3. Use the `left-arrow` and `right arrow` keys to position your cursor within the command and edit it
4. Use the `Backspace/Delete` keys to delete letters
5. Type in the middle of the command to insert new letters
6. NOTE: You can hit the `ENTER` key at any time (not just at the end of the line)
	1. So, you cursor-left, edit, and hit `ENTER` in the middle of the command and it will submit it
	2. You don't have to cursor all the way to the right before you hit ENTER
7. Use the `TAB` key to `autocomplete` file names
	6. Enter the first few letters of the file name and hit `TAB` and the Terminal will type the rest
	7. If you hear a 'bell' and you don't see the completed filename, it's because there are more than one completions
	8. Hit the TAB key twice and you'll see a list of possible completions
	9. Continue typing characters and hit TAB again
8. In case that wasn't clear: Hitting TAB+TAB (hitting TAB twice) shows a list of files
