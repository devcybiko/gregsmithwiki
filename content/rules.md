# Greg's Rules
1.  I only do things where I either produce something, or learn something. All else is waste
	1. Spending time with people reenforces harmony in relationships
2.  Say yes when you can and no when you must
3.  Have a "Yes-And" attitude
4.  Assume positive intent
5.  Adapt, Improvise, Overcome
6.  you don’t need to know everything to get started
7.  Don’t complain unless you want something to change
8. Be on time
	1. If you can't be on time - alert the other person as soon as possible
	2. Be 5-15 minutes early. The Marines say "on time is late."

9. Showing up is 80% of success
