# MacBook Minimum Recommendations for Developers

## A MacBook Air is Fine, MacBook Pro is better

-   i5 processor of any speed should be OK. (An i7 processor will be more powerful, but not necessary.)
-   16GB is recommended for software development (remember the more RAM, the more tabs you can have open on your browser and the more apps/programs you can run simultaneously). 8GB will get you by, but your mac may feel sluggish under heavy usage.
-   256GB storage (SSD) as a minimum. But I recommend 512GB because you'll likely load a lot of disk intensive programs (MS-Office, VSCode, Mac Development tools, MySQL, Mongodb, Anaconda).
-   MacBook air only has 2 USB-C side ports. I recommend getting a couple add-ons:
-   a USB-C hub: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QQ11BP6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QQ11BP6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
-   and a few converter dongles for any USB-A devices you have: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DNQ9FD9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DNQ9FD9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
-   Together they will add about $70 to your purchase, but you'll find them very handy.
-   Optionally, consider getting a case to carry your "dongles" in:
-   [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017SKRWL4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017SKRWL4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (This one is about $18, but any carrying case will do)
-   Also, I recommended the Apple Refurbished/Clearance site. You get 15% off the price and the device has had a personal review and carries the same warrantee as a ‘new’ Mac. If your Mac breaks down they’ll repair or replace (potentially with a new Mac)

-   Last thought... sign up for [Dropbox.com](http://dropbox.com/) and get the app. It will syncronize your files with their cloud storage. If your Mac is lost, stolen or need replacing - all your data will be backed up. Any storage solution will do including [Box.com](http://box.com/) and [iCloud.com](http://icloud.com/) (Apple's backup system). You can get a 2GB Dropbox for free.
