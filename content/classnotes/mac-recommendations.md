# MacBook Minimum Recommendations for Developers

## A MacBook Air is Fine, MacBook Pro is better

-   **i5 processor** of any speed should be OK. (An i7 processor will be more powerful, but not necessary.)
-   **16GB RAM** is recommended for software development (remember the more RAM, the more tabs you can have open on your browser and the more apps/programs you can run simultaneously). 8GB will get you by, but your Mac may feel sluggish under heavy usage.
-   **512GB storage (SSD)** is recommended. But you can get by on 256GB. I recommend 512GB because you'll likely load a lot of disk intensive programs (MS-Office, VSCode, Mac Development tools, MySQL, Mongodb, Anaconda).
-   MacBook Air only has 2 USB-C side ports. I recommend getting a couple add-ons:
-   **A USB-C hub:** ($70) [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QQ11BP6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QQ11BP6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
-   **A few converter dongles** for any USB-A devices you have: ($7.75 for three) [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DNQ9FD9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DNQ9FD9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
-   Together they will add about $70 to your purchase, but you'll find them very handy.
-   Optionally, consider getting a **case to carry** your "dongles" in: ($18)
-   [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017SKRWL4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017SKRWL4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (This one is about $18, but any carrying case will do)
-   Also, I recommended the **Apple Refurbished/Clearance site**. You get **15% off** the price and the device gets a personal review and carries the same warrantee as a ‘new’ Mac. If your Mac breaks down they’ll repair or replace it (potentially with a new Mac)
-   [https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished](https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished)
-   Sign up for [**Dropbox.com**](http://dropbox.com/) and get the app. It will synchronize your files with their cloud storage. If your Mac is lost, stolen or needs replacing - all your data will be backed up. Any storage solution will do including [Box.com](http://box.com/) and [iCloud.com](http://icloud.com/) (Apple's backup system). You can get a 2GB Dropbox for free.
- **TOTAL COST**: About **$1439** for the MacBook plus $100 for dongles/hub/case. And $9.95/mo for 1TB Dropbox.com backups.
- Final Thoughts: Macs retain their value. I will upgrade my Mac every 2-3 years. I sell my old Mac on eBay for about 50% the price of a new Mac. Then I buy a new Mac on the Apple/Refurbish site, saving another 15%. This means I get an upgrade every 2-3 years for 35% the cost of a new Mac. But I have Macs that are 9 years old and still perform as well as the day I bought them.
- Also, consider getting the best Mac you can afford. Macs are not user-upgradable. Both the memory and SSD are soldered in place.
- Finally compare this to the purchase of a car. If you spend $25,000 for a 'nused' car - consider how many hours you actually drive it a day. Maybe 2hrs/day. In contrast consider how many hours a day you'll use your Mac. For me it's about 8-12 hours a day. **It's easy to see that dollar-for-dollar getting a "professional" Mac makes sense if you're going to be a professional developer.**
