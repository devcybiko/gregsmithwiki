1.  Does educational attainment impact voter registration rates?
2.  Does socioeconomic status impact voter registration rates?
3. Does geographic location impact voter registration rates?  
4. Does tenure at residence impact voter registration rates?All data will be taken from the census information provided by the United States Census Bureau specifically from the 2016 Presidential Election datasets.

Data: Border Crossing  
Data: Population data for surrounding citiesQuestions:  
What modes of transportation are the most utilized?  
Congestion at different entry points? (How long it takes to get through, population of travel?)  
Proximity of cities within 50 miles?  
If we were going to add an entry point where would add?

**Population density in north America (near borders):**

Is there a correlation between the music genres you listen to and your income level? We will take into account people's age groups, income, location to determine any correlation.

Project 1 Proposal:  Impacts on Education
Write this as a brief summary of your interests and intent, including:
* The kind of data you'd like to work with/field you're interested in (e.g., geodata, weather data, etc.)
	-	Government - taxes Carrie
	-	School/neighborhood - Victoria
	-	Student data - Dinesh
* The kinds of questions you'll be asking of that data
	- How underfunding of schools impact of neighborhoods (compare affluency to drop out rates)
	- Do tax revenue generating localities correlate with school success?  Do areas with shrinking tax bases have an impact on school success?
	- Investigate disincentives for student engagement 
* Possible source for such data
	- Census
	- Assessor and Property Tax Records
	- School attendance data

We plan on looking at what causes obesity and looking into what leads to higher causes of obesity...we plan to make a heat map and mapping of the locations based on the locations of these restaurants, hopefully will be able to somehow breakdown prevalence of obesity by city as well as well as using scatter plots and bar graphs to show the relationship between sugary drink consumption and obesity, and we also plan to use bar and scatter plots to show the relationship between education, income level, and obesity

Here are our datasets we plan to use
