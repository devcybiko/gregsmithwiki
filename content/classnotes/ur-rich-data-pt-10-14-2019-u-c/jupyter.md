# Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook Page

•Create a new Python file using Jupyter Notebook, making sure to set the kernel as “PythonData”

•Setting the kernel for Jupyter projects is important because these kernels let the program know which libraries will be available for use. Only those libraries loaded into the development environment selected can be used in a Jupyter Notebook project.

•If the user’s development environment does not show up within Jupyter Notebook, simply run the command `conda install -c anaconda nb_conda_kernels` within the terminal so that anaconda environments can be used as kernels.
