# GitLab Pull

When we udpate the GitLab Repo (UR-RICH-DATA-PT-10-2019-U-C) it's very easy to get the latest files.

We'll update the GitLab with such things as
* Slides
* Next Week's Activities
* Next Week's Homeworks

## Instructions

Do the following commands in your Terminal:
<pre>
cd ~/git/UR-RICH-DATA-PT-10-2019-U-C
git pull
ls -latr
</pre>

This will pull the latest files from GitLab and list them on the Terminal.
