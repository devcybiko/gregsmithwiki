# Basic PR (Pull Request) Workflow

This activity allows students to practice pushing local branches to GitHub; opening pull requests for those branches; and reviewing submitted code. **This activity must be completed in succession with previous one**â€”it cannot stand alone.

## Instructions

* After pulling the updated `master` branch, each team member should create a new branch, named according to the formula: `<name>/<name of feature>`.

-- git checkout -b greg/new_feature

* Add or change whatever you'd like on this branch.

-- touch fubar.txt (edit it to you liking)

* Once you're done making changes, push the branch to GitHub.

-- git push origin greg/new_feature

* Next, navigate to your repository in the browser.

* Find the drop-down menu on the top right of your repository's file display.

  * Click it, and select the new branch you just pushed.

  * Open a **Pull Request** against this branch.

-- PULL REQUEST

* Next, find and click the Pull Requests tab near the top of the repository.

* Click one of your teammates' Pull Requests.

  * Explore the pull request. In particular, take a look at the **Files Changed** tab.

  * Leave a comment on the pull request.

  * Then, approve and merge it, using the GUI provided in the browser.

* Discuss the advantages and disadvantages to PR workflow like this one, and if your team will use this approach to manage projects.
