# Chapter 3 - White & Bell

White sat in the basement of the Starbuck University computer science building peering through a microscope [determine actual name of microscope used by computer technicians]. Curls of smoke rose around his thin-rimmed glasses as he super-heated resin with an air gun on the motherboard of a student’s MacBook. A young woman sat next to him waiting impatiently, constantly checking her iPhone.

“They really shouldn’t recommend MacBooks of less than sixteen gigabytes of RAM to you first-year students,” White said. “It’s not nearly enough memory for you to do your assignments and run all the apps you need to support them at the same time.”

The student waved her hand in front of her face to diffuse the smoke. “I guess. I just got the minimum recommended to save money.”

“Well,” White said, “these computers are not user upgradable – but I have all the parts to get you up-to-snuff. How did you happen to find me? I don’t exactly make myself available to students.”

“Oh, my best friend said you fixed her Mac when she got a virus. Everyone said it was dead, but she turned it into facilities, and when it came back the invoice had your faculty ID number on it. So, I googled you and found out where you worked. I’m very appreciative, Dr. White.”

“It’s Mister White, I don’t have a degree. And for Pete’s sake keep this under your hat. I can’t afford to fix every child’s toy. Yes, we’re seeing a lot of those viruses.”

 She didn’t reply to White’s condescension, but he did notice she rolled her eyes at him. 

“Well, a lot of us are finding our grades on the internet. It’s like, an entire class’s roster and their last exam grades shows up on Facebook. It’s kinda embarrassing, you know? Anyway, she thought maybe her virus was, like, you know, doing it.”

“Well, that’s not likely. A virus on one student’s computer wouldn’t share everyone’s grades. Still, it is very odd. Why would someone post just grades? Seems like there are bigger fish to fry.”

White reassembled the device and slid it across the wooden workbench to the youngster. “There, reboot it and login. Then check the system memory to make sure it says sixteen gigs.”

“Oh, how do I do that?”

White grimaced. How can these children learn to write software when they don’t even know how to use their computers? He went through the steps to get the system information up and made sure she could repeat the steps herself.

“By the way,” White said, “what class are you using this computer for?”

“Oh, it’s Data Analysis. It’s really stupid. There’s all this talk of Pythons and Pandas and stuff. I’m pretty lost. I just want to get a computer science degree so I can get into a tech company. I’ll put in a few years of programming and move into management.”

*My God, doesn’t anyone want to build anything anymore?* Still he couldn’t resist the temptation to at least spark an interest in the fine art of computer programming.

“Ah. Well. Let’s take a look at your homework.”

The girl opened up the homework folder on her Mac and started reading out loud. White listened, not speaking. Then he showed her how to edit the code using the Python computing language, run it, import the Panda math libraries for data analysis – but insisted she do the actual keyboard entries. Then he pointed her to a website that explained how to use Python “comprehensions” to calculate her statistics. Despite herself, she seemed quite interested.

“So, now I can calculate the average consumption of alcohol in the United States? Will that be good enough for the homework?” When White nodded yes, the girl gathered up her Mac and slid it into her backpack.

“Now, remember,” White said, “when you are slaying pythons and pandas, you need to keep your comprehensions about you,” White winked with a toothy grin. 

“Thanks, Dr. White,” the girl said as she slung the backpack over her arm. “I’ll remember.”

“It’s Mister White. Now, run along and do great things.”

White watched as the student weaved her way through the maze of electrical equipment, workbenches, and cabinets. She nearly collided with two well-dressed adults who had just entered. 

“Oh, excuse me, Miss Shields,” she said as she slid out the door and up the steps.

“Mr. White,” Shields said, “we have a guest. Dr. Bell has come to join us here at SBU. He’s taking over the PhD program and asked to see you.”

White stood up and looked Bell over from across the room. “Jim… Your name is Jim.”

Bell rolled his eyes. “Al, don’t. It’s been a long day and I really don’t have the time. I have a job for you.”

“You came back for me… Why would you do this?” White moved closer, eyeing Bell closely.

“What does he mean, do you know each other?” Shields looked at White again.

Bell let out a sigh. “It’s from Star Trek…” Bell looked back at White. “Because the needs of the many... outweigh the needs of the few...”

“… or the one,” White turned away and walked a couple steps, then turned back.

“I have been and always shall be… your friend.”

Shields looked from one man to the other, “Oh. I didn’t realize.”

Bell looked despairingly at her and nodded. Then to White, “Yes, White. Yes.”

White closed the gap between him and Bell and asked more emphatically: “The ship, out of danger?”

Bell replied: “Yes, Al. You saved us. You saved us all.”

White’s face dropped. His shoulders slumped. And he stepped back from Bell: “No. I didn’t save anyone. And you know it. What the hell do you want, Jim?”

***

“No way. The last thing I need is to be responsible to anyone. I don’t want it.”

White felt his cheeks turn red. He had cleared a spot on his workbench for him and Bell to talk. Bell explained that he had a meeting with Dean Walters and wanted to catch up with White.

“Look, it’s not a job, really. I just need you to vet these new candidates. I don’t have the time and you’re the only person I trust with the job… I mean, the task,” Bell explained.

“It’s frickin’ babysitting is what it is. There’s a reason I’ve retreated to this dungeon. I don’t want a job and I don’t want to deal with people. And I’m none too happy about you stalking me and throwing this in my face.”

“I didn’t stalk you. I had heard rumors that you had settled in Troy and the rest was simple googling. When I learned you were down here in SBU’s basement fixing computers I couldn’t believe my luck. This is right up your alley. It’s a problem that needs solving and you get to berate a bunch of grad students.”

“Rumors? Where the hell did you hear rumors?”

“Well, I reached out to Sorin and asked if he knew anyone in New York who might be able to do the work. He named a few folks from the old days, old RPI chums, and I didn’t want any of them. Then he mentioned you were lurking somewhere around Troy, and I took it from there.”

“Sorin? That bastard? Now I definitely don’t want this. I just don’t do people, Jim. Computers are honest. They do only what you tell them too. They don’t lie to you - unless they’re broken. That’s why I like to fix them.”

“And how, exactly is that different from people? I know a few broken people myself, Al. One quite personally, if you get my drift. This could be good for you. You get to be the smartest guy in the room again and contribute back to the university.”

“I’m always the smartest guy in the room, Bell. I don’t see anything in it for me. I’m out.”

Bell thought the conversation might go this direction. “Look, I have to catch up with my wife in a few minutes. Let’s table this and get together tonight for drinks. Is that old bar and grill still open? You remember the one down in Troy that served those sandwiches named after Sherlock Holmes stories?”

“You mean *Holmes & Watson*? Yeah, I’ve been there a few times.”

“Great. Let’s get together tomorrow night and lift a few - I have to talk to Ana and it’s getting late. Do you have a smartphone? I’ll text you.”

White looked at Bell incredulously, “Of course I have a smartphone. I’m a misanthrope, not a luddite. Tell me your number.” Bell gave him his digits and White texted “FU” so that his number was on Bell’s phone and Bell’s on his. Bell gave a wry smile at the text.

“I’ll see you tomorrow at sixish. Bring cash.” White said.

Back in his hotel room, Bell reached for the light switch as he entered the room.

“Yes, I’ve just checked in, Ana. It’s been a long day. Walters wants me to start early, gave me some scope creep, and I ran into an old friend. How’s your day going?”

On his iPhone, Bell could see his wife’s wrinkled forehead. “Early? How early? Not that it matters. Most everything on this end is wrapped up. You might have to shack up at the Motel 6 for a few weeks while I finalize details. What does Walters have in mind?”

Bell related the events of the day. Ana gave a wry grin. “Well, that’s academia for you – wait then hurry up. Look, James, we agreed this was the right move for us. The fact that it comes a few months earlier is just a twist in the plot. If you’ll handle things in the Great North, I’ll handle them down here and we’ll come together in a couple months and pick a place to settle. Plan?”

James Bell often appreciated his wife’s approach to marriage, but never more than in situations like this. He remembered their honeymoon, back when there wasn’t much money to go around. They went to Outback to celebrate and she pointed a fork at him over the table: *We’re partners – we do what’s best for the partnership*. And she lived up to that promise. And to be fair, he thought, so had he.

“Plan,” he said. He dropped his bags, kicked off his shoes and flopped onto the bed, looking up at the ceiling and Ana’s visage. “How are things at the practice?”

“The same. I’m transferring clients and wrapping up with the partners. There are plenty of psychologists in the city, so I’m not having trouble referring folks around town. The hardest part is making sure I don’t offend any friends by not thinking of them.”

Bell smiled inwardly as he knew Ana was easily the least offensive of people. Nobody would feel slighted if she sent a client one place or the other. “I’m sure it will be fine. You’ve got this…”

The rest of the conversation centered around potential subdivisions and home styles. Since the schedule was moved up, Ana googled the nearby developments while they spoke. Bell recounted his drive up the Northway.

“Ok, Ana, I’m calling it a night. I have to re-read Walter’s notes and plan my meeting with White tomorrow night. It’s going to take some convincing on my part – for both of them.”

“Are you sure you really want him? I remember you talking about him – he doesn’t sound all that stable.”

Bell closed his eyes. “He’s not unstable - he’s just an asshole. A genius – but still an asshole. And like most ‘stable geniuses’ (he shared a look with Ana) he will need some boundaries. It’ll be fine. And thanks for the concern. I’m signing off now.”

Ana gave her goodnights, and the phone went dark. Bell dropped the device next to him on the bed. He closed his eyes for only a second – and when he opened them, it was morning.

Bell roused; a bit disgusted with himself for sleeping in his suit. There was a lot of work to be done. While he disrobed, he turned on the TV. The local newscasters were far too perky for his tastes. By the time he had stripped down for a shower, a story caught his attention.

“It seems some local college students will be getting coal in their stockings this Christmas break,” the blonde woman began. “A posting on Twitter today listed the grade point averages of several undergraduate students at Starbuck University. And a number of them are well under a one-point-oh. We have a report from the campus. What do they say there, Adam?”

The older newscaster, who reminded Bell of Ronald Reagan, was interviewing a young man in front of the university’s entrance. “I’m here with freshman Bryan Collins. Bryan, were your grades posted online today?”

The youngster looked into the camera. “Yeah. We totally got hacked. I was lucky. My grades are pretty good. So, it’s no skin off my nose. But I have friends who are in the square root club. I mean, none of us are happy about this. But if your grades are that low, you may not be coming back next session.”

The newscaster pointed his microphone back to himself. “What is the ‘square root club’?” 

Bell knew this term and was a bit surprised kids still used it.

The youngster looked back at the newsman. “It’s when the square root of your GPA is greater than your actual GPA. You see,” Bell winced as he saw some “geeksplaining” coming. “The square root is a number that when multiplied by itself results in the original number. It’s usually quite a bit smaller than the original. If you take the square root of a number less than one, it’s actually bigger than the original. So, you don’t want to be in the square root club!”

“Interesting information, Bryan. University officials could not be reached for comment this morning, despite our repeated attempts for information. Back to you Candice.”

Bell suddenly realized he was naked in front of the television and felt a little embarrassed despite himself. *I guess we’re exposed in more ways than one.* His phone rang. He recognized it was Walters and he threw the call to voicemail. He was in no position to discuss the matter with her, and he did not want a dressing down in his current state.

---

Back at SBU, Bell returned to Walters’ office. He had texted her that he was on his way, seeing that there was no voicemail on his phone. He’d only been on the job a day and already he was being called into the principal’s office.

“Dr. Bell, I assume you’ve read the notes I sent you?”

Bell had, and he indicated as much. The amount of data sent to the internet had been small up until now. This latest breach was the largest and most embarrassing. No one but University staff were aware of the breach, but now it had reached the local news. The data itself was fairly innocuous. While GPAs are considered private information, nobody could be harmed by its release. The real damage would be if and when it reached the national news. The embarrassment alone was cause for concern.

“I know you’ve only been on the job for a day, but you need to get on top of this. The board is already aware of the problem and they have made it clear that we’re all on the hook to resolve it. That means you as well.”

Bell had been down this path many times. Walters wasn’t specifically reprimanding him. It was a required dance. In order to show highers-up that she took the matter seriously, she had to put the heat on someone. In turn, Bell had to take full responsibility, despite the fact that he had no hand in the matter at all. He also had to lay out a plan despite the fact that he had none. This allowed Walters to report back to the board that someone had been properly flayed, and she had a plan for remediation. Bell danced along.

“Yes, of course. I’ve already pulled in Al White who is on-site in the Turing building. He’s been briefed and has some ideas. He’s had experience in this sort of thing. Between us, he’s a bit rusty, but he has my full confidence.”

“Yes, I am aware of Mr. White’s credentials, such as they are. He has, shall we say, a shady reputation. I don’t interfere in my managers’ staffing choices. But you’ll be responsible for all of his actions. Am I clear?”

And so, the dance was over. “Yes, ma’am.”

Seeing that Walters had returned to her computer, Bell got up to leave. As he put his hand on the doorknob, he heard her stop typing. “Oh, one more thing…”

Bell stopped short, feeling a bit of déjà vu. “Yes,” he turned.

“I’ve sent a list of candidates for the Ph.D. program to your inbox. These are all students we lured away from RPI. I’d appreciate it if you could interview them by the end of the week.”

Bell wondered how she could have “lured” Ph.D. candidates away from their prestigious counterpart. Walters looked up, anticipating his question.

“Let’s just say, they have issues. Thank you, Bell.”

----

White entered _Holmes and Watson_ and picked Bell out of the crowd, sitting at the bar. The air was the same combination of smoke, stale beer, and pizza as his college days. He took the stool next to Bell and motioned for a beer. 

“I’m stunned,” Bell started. “I can’t believe this place is still operating,” Bell started. “There aren’t many things that are left over from our days at Rensselaer.”

White nodded. “Yes. Troy isn’t much more sophisticated now than it was then. But the rest of the county has grown quite a bit. Say…” White leaned closer to Bell’s ear. “Do you know why RPI doesn’t slide down the hill?”

Bell grimaced in anticipation. “No, why?”

“Because RPI sucks and Troy blows.”

Bell winced, “Nice language. Look, I’ve got quite a predicament on my hands and I could use your help.”

White took a pull on his beer and glanced sideways at Bell. “You mean more than just babysitting your brats? No thanks, I don’t do that sort of thing anymore, Jim.”

“You don’t even know what I want. Let me explain and then you can tell me you don’t want to do it.”

“I don’t need to know what it is. I know you wouldn’t ask for my help unless it dealt with software and I’m officially out of that business, as you well know. I’m not going to be of any use to you.”

“Look, Walters pushed up my deadlines and added a new role. I need to build a computer forensics lab and hire someone to run the thing. I just need you to do the legwork and act as director until I can find someone.”

“No. There’s a reason I’m stuck in the basement of the Turing building fixing computers. I’m on permanent parole. And for that matter, I’ve exiled myself there. I’m very happy doing repairs and helping the odd child with their homework.”

“Child?”

“Well, yes. These kids in the computer science department. They’re all children." *Were we ever so young?*

“White, they’re adults. Look, I’m getting a flock of PhD students next month and I need someone with your knowledge and experience to manage the forensics lab while I get the PhD program running.”

White ignored the latter point. “Well so far as I’m concerned, anyone under the age of 25 is a child. Children who are having sex like bunnies. They don’t think people see, but these kids are swapping partners like a barnyard square dance. It’s pretty remarkable.”

“You’re avoiding the topic. I need you and I’m betting you can use the cash. Where are you staying?”

White gulped again. “At the shelter on Main.”

Bell nearly choked on his beer. “You’re freaking homeless? What the fuck, man?”

“It’s shelter. Any roof that keeps the rain off my computer is home. I have a desk, a bed, and a shower. I don’t need much else – although decent internet access would be nice. So, no. I don’t need the cash.”

“Well, Anabel and I are moving here soon, maybe you can room with us. Meanwhile, Ludd is prepping the Turing building for the lab. It has about two-dozen rooms. There’s going to be a refurb converting half into housing, and the rest as office space for the lab. But I still need someone to vet the students and the new director. Why don’t you move into one of those rooms and help me with this project?”

“Wait. Your wife’s name is Anabel? Please tell me she kept her maiden name.”

Bell’s cheeks reddened slightly. “No. She took my name.”

“You forced this poor woman to be Ana bel-Bell? That’s just cruel.”

“Well you’re the first person to say it out loud. Which reminds me, she’s coming into town Monday. We’re having a small gathering and you’re expected. She wants to meet you.”

“I’m not one for parties. However, I am intrigued to meet the woman who would put up with you and this ridiculous name you’ve foisted upon her. But I’m still not running your little dog and pony show.”

Bell rolled his eyes. “Ok. I’ll email you the invite.” Then, echoing Walters’ comment he added: “There is one more thing I think will interest you. Walters asked me to look into a data leak from the campus computers. It seems someone is sharing faculty details on the dark web.”

This gave White a moment of pause. “Really? That is odd. How much data did they leak?”

“That’s what’s strange. It looks like it’s been a very small amount of data on a weekly basis. At first it was social security numbers, which is concerning. But when faculty salaries started showing up, the board got very worried.”

White chuckled. “Um… they do realize that social security numbers are a bigger deal than salaries, right? I mean, you can take over bank accounts, credit cards, even steal mortgage titles with that kind of data.”

Bell smiled back. “Well, no. These are board members, not computer scientists. They really didn’t show any concern until the faculty started complaining about their compensation.”

Bell lowered his voice and looked intently at White. “Look, I hate to ask this way, but I feel as if you owe me one.”

White paused his drink in mid-air. “That’s a low blow, James. I’m not sure you did me any real favors.”

“Well, if I hadn’t intervened you might have ended up in jail rather than on parole. Some people wanted to charge you with espionage. I don’t trust anyone else with this task and I need the assist. Besides, this could be a win for both of us. You’ll get a proper space to live in as well as all the Wi-Fi you can use. And I’ll get to work with my old roommate again. It’ll be just like our times at Crocket Hall.”

White locked eyes with Bell’s. At last he relented. “Alright, Jim. I’ll play your little game. But only until the new director is installed. Then I’m back to my comfortable little job in the basement: fixing laptops and schooling children on the finer points of coding,” and his tone turned serious again. “But then we’re even.”

Bell grabbed White’s hand and shook it vigorously. “Done! Let me give you a ride home. I’ll send you my notes and we’ll get started Monday morning.”

White drained his mug and wiped his beard on the back of his sleeve. “I'll walk. Don’t get too excited, Jim. Remember, I dropped out of college, and our time at the agency wasn’t exactly stellar. Our track record together isn’t all that great.”

Bell left a twenty and replied, “Have faith, White. It’s going to be great.”
