# Chapter 1 - White

Al White pushed his computer cart down the hallway of Knuth Hall. Starbuck University was young - everything still smelled of fresh paint and new carpeting. After over 10 years, he thought the place would level out some. But it stilled smelled like a virgin.

He was looking for room K-2014 – a cubicle farm for first-year students. In his cart was a handful of laptops that he’d just repaired. One of them belonged to a student who needed a memory upgrade. When he turned the corner, he heard what he could only describe as a ‘ruckus’ down the hall. As he approached, it turned out to be the room he was looking for.

Upon entering, he noticed the layout had changed from the typical matrix of cubes. This was a war room layout: cubes along the walls, a conference table in the center, and a projector lighting up the far wall. An array of students surrounded the table and someone he recognized as Professor Donaldson was talking to the screen where two young men looked very worried.

“Did you press the escape key,” Donaldson was shouting while pressing a button on the telecom box.

One of the boys turned to the camera and said he had, many times.

“Excuse, me. Is there a Miss Able here? I have her laptop,” White interrupted.

“Not now, White. We have an emergency.” Turning back to the screen Donaldson asked: “What did the engineer say to do?”

The second boy answered this time. “He said when the temperature starts to rise, press the Q key to dismiss the window and it would level out. But every time we press Q it just raises the temperature a little more. Q is for quit, right?”

White was interested now. He approached the screen, leaving the cart outside. “Hey, Donaldson, is that an Eye-din display? I haven’t seen one of those since the eighties.”

Donaldson turned on White. “Really, White, we’re busy here. Can you just drop off your wares and get lost?”

White examined the computer monitor that was shimmering on the projection screen before him. “Yup. Eiden. They were state of the art in the mid-eighties. Graphics displays with custom keyboards and a trackball. It was considered high-resolution for its time and predated the mouse-and-windows movement. What are you guys doing with an Eiden? And why is that red rectangle flashing? You do know that flashing lights are a bad practice for user interfaces, yes? Epilepsy and all that.”

Donaldson pursed his lips and stepped between White and the screen. “Look, this is an emergency. Will you please get the heck out of here while we resolve this?”

“What kind of emergency can children get into? Here…” White turned away from Donaldson and pushed the speak button on the comm. “Hey boys, where the hell are you anyway?”

One of the boys, a light-haired lad of about five feet four inches replied: “Hello? We’re in Fallujah at the gas turbine plant. Who is this?”

White turned back to Donaldson. “Fallujah… Egypt? You sent those children to frickin’ Egypt? What in the world are you thinking?”

Donaldson straightened, “It’s an internship. Walters approved it. They’re learning fundamentals of control systems. This is their second day.”

“Of all the lame ideas. Hang on a second.” White returned to the comm unit, pressing the button and looking at the youngsters on the screen. “I’m Al White. Boys, who am I talking to? And talk fast because if I read that display correctly, we’ve only got about three minutes to cool that turbine.”

The second boy, taller with dark hair came to the fore. He replied without needing to click a button – apparently their side was not on mute: “I’m Tom and this is also Tom. They call us The Tom Twins.”

Great, ambiguous names. White hated ambiguity with a passion. “So, you’re the Tom-Tom Club? How do I address you each absolutely? Do you go by your last names or what?” 

Taller-Tom again: “They usually call me Sophomore Tom because I’m a year ahead of Regular Tom.”

“Nice. Okay Sophomore Tom, do me a favor and move me closer to the computer so I can see the screen and keyboard.”

Sophomore Tom looked puzzled. “Closer? But you’re in upstate New York. How can I get you closer?”

Regular Tom elbowed Sophomore Tom out of the way. “I’m sorry Dr. White. Tom can be a bit dense at times. Here, let me move you closer.” Regular Tom picked up the laptop and carried it closer to the display and keyboard.

“Thank you, Regular Tom. And call me Mister White, or sir. I don’t have a degree. Okay… I’ve seen enough. Put me down so I can watch the monitor. Did you boys get any training on this system before you started pushing buttons?”

“I guess so,” Sophomore Tom said. “There was this old guy in here yesterday. He showed us a bunch of stuff. I guess he was the engineer.”

“You guess? There is no guessing in computing, son. Now was he the engineer or not?”

“Yes. Dr. White,” Sophomore Tom answered, before he was corrected by Regular Tom. “I mean Mr. White. They laid him off after he trained us yesterday. I don’t think he was very happy.”

I should think not. “Okay lads. I noticed the desktop was raised about four feet off the floor – is that the way the engineer kept it?”

Donaldson stepped in again. “White. Step away from that phone or I’ll have security remove you. You are a repairman and nothing more. This is my project and I won’t have you interfering.”

White was undeterred. “Is that the way he kept it? And answer fast because we’re down to about two minutes.”

“No sir, I raised it up,” Sophomore Tom again. “It’s one of those electric tables that lets you stand while working. It helps me think.”

“I see. So, you can only stand to reason, is that it, Sophomore Tom?”

“Huh? I don’t know.”

More like Sophomoric Tom. “Was the engineer a touch typist, by any chance?”

Sophomore Tom turned to look at Regular Tom who replied. “Yes. I think he was. He could watch the monitor and run the software without looking at the keyboard.”

“I see. Okay… And what are the letters on the top row of the keyboard”

The two Toms looked together. Sophomore Tom: “I see 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.0.” White winced.

Regular Tom noticed this and pushed the other out of the way. “I’m sorry, sir. It’s a standard QWERTY keyboard.”

“I see. Now are either of you boys touch typists? That is, can you type on the keyboard without looking at it? Or are you hunt-and-peck typists?”

Sophomore Tom put his full face in the camera. “Well, kinda. I mean. I can read sheet music and play piano without looking at the keys. Does that help?”

“Thank you, Sophomore Tom. Is there a piano in the control room? I’m just asking.”

“Uhhh… no. I don’t think so. Let me look around…”

“Don’t bother. Sophomore Tom, will you please leave the lab… You’re of no use to me and a danger to all.”

Sophomore Tom could be seen exiting, screen left and murmuring “Whatever…”

“Okay, Regular Tom. It’s just you and me now. From what I can see the temperature is nearly critical. Do you see the picture-in-picture in the upper right corner? It’s a live video of the exterior of the turbine.”

“Oh. Yes sir. What’s that orange spot?”

“Good eye, Tom. Yes. That’s the metal casing of the engine. It’s called the cowling. And that orange spot is where the metal is becoming super-heated. In about sixty seconds it will get to be about the size of a half-dollar. Hang on a second…”

White pulled on Donaldson’s elbow. “Dr. Donaldson, could you come to the camera, please? Tom, can you see Dr. Donaldson’s face? What color would you say that is?”

Tom looked into the camera. “I’d say his face is flushed, pink, maybe? Ruddy?”

“That’s about right. Hang on a tick...”

White took his thumb off the comm button. “So, Donaldson. Did you have sex with your wife this morning? I’m just curious.”

“White… that’s completely inappropriate. We’re in a state of emergency and I don’t have time for this nonsense.”

“Okay. So, no missionary for you today. Did she at least give you a blow job?”

Donaldson yanked his arm away from White’s grip. “For the love of Mike, man. Have some decency.”

White looked closer at Donaldson’s face. “Not quite there. So, you went into the bathroom and beat off, as usual. That would explain the cum stain on your tie.”

Donaldson pulled his tie up to examine it. “You… Bastard. Mother Fucker…”

“Geez, Donaldson. I was only kidding. But it is interesting that you looked. Now come talk to young Tom a sec… Tom… what color would you say Dr. Donaldson’s face is now?”

Tom’s eyebrows went up. “Oh... wow. I’d say that was beet red.”

“Yes. That’s about right. So, Tom, if we don’t get that rig cooled off in the next minute or so, that orange spot is going to grow. And in the center of that spot is going to be a dot that is…” he looked questioningly at a wide-eyed young woman who blurted out “beet red.” 

“Yes, beet red. Sort of like an Amazonian areola. So, if that happens, it means the metal has liquified. It will begin to drip into the turbine, cool, and return to its solid state. Do you know what happens next, Tom?”

“Um… kerblewie?”

“Yes, I believe that is the technical term. So, let’s keep that from happening. Tell me quickly, what the engineer told you to do.”

“He said to push the W button to open a window and the default program would run. I think the default program is set to Turbine Test protocol. And he said to hit the Q button to quit the program. But we kept hitting the Q button and windows kept popping up.”

“Right. So, you looked at the keyboard, and hit the key labeled Q and more Turbine Test programs started running. Hang on a second Tom…”

Turning to Dr. Donaldson. “Donaldson, do you know the standard keyboard used in the United States?”

“I don’t see how that matters. Will you please just get that turbine under control?”

“Well, in other countries they use the Dvorak keyboard. Same letters, but a completely different layout from the U.S. We use the “QWERTY” standard, so-named because the top row of letters are: Q-W-E-R-T-Y. When Eiden was at their peak in the eighties, they served countries all over the world. So, they delivered the keyboards in two boxes: one for a basic keyboard with no key caps, and a second with the keycaps, loose in the box. Now, my first job was as an intern at General Electric Gas Turbine in Schenectady. Not far from here, I might add. And my job was to put the keycaps on the keyboards in the right order. As a joke, I sometimes swapped the keys to confuse the engineers – who were all hunt-and-peckers… no pun intended. I eventually convinced my boss to require all engineers to learn to touch type so they wouldn’t rely on their eyes – which could fool them. Are you with me so far?”

Donaldson was slack-jawed. “What does this have to do…”

“Well, these boys are hunt-and-peckers. So, they did what they were told. The engineer left them with a little joke. I doubt he intended harm. But he swapped the Q and W keys – I noticed it when they pointed the laptop camera at the keyboard. So, the boys have been hitting the W – or window key - all day, not the Q or quit key, which resulted in running multiple copies of the Turbine Test. The Turbine Test is fairly innocuous, as long as it runs by itself and you turn it off within an hour. But I’ll bet those boys have run about two dozen of those tests concurrently now and that turbine is just screaming up a storm. Hence, the molten metal on the cowl. So, would you like to tell young Tom what to do next?”

Donaldson shook his head, “I … I don’t know…”

“I see… Tom?” White returned to the comm. “How is that areola doing?” 

“It’s quite a bit larger and the center is approaching beet red.”

“Okay. Look at the keyboard and start hitting the W key. Watch the RPM meter on the monitor and let me know if it starts revving down.”

Tom followed his instructions. “Yes, the RPMs are going down. Do I just keep hitting W forever?”

“Well, until all the Turbine Test windows are gone. Yes. By the way Tom, do you have a credit card?”

“No sir, they pay us per diem in cash, so I don’t need one. Besides, my dad won’t let me have one until I get a proper job.”

“Prudent man. I like him already. So, how much do they pay you?”

“About twenty five a day. Will my security pass card do? It’s about the same size as a credit card.”

“Yes. Pop off the W and Q keys and swap them – they’re in the wrong places. That’ll put the keyboard to rights and Sophomoric Tom won’t rev up the turbines anymore. How is that temperature doing?”

“It’s going down and I think the areola is getting smaller.”

“Good man, Tom. You’ll be fine. I’m going offline now. When you get home, look me up. I’m in the basement of the Turing building. I’ll buy you a coke and give you a quick lesson in negotiations. Twenty five dollars a day is pitiful.”

“Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. White. I’ll definitely take you up on that.”

He removed his thumb from the speaker button with a loud click. To Donaldson: “What logic led you to believe you could send two boys to run a gas turbine plant in Fallujah, Egypt, Donaldson?”

“We got a contract with the Saudis. They got rid of all their full timers and we replaced them with students. The students get valuable training and hands-on with classic control systems, it’s a win-win. It was all approved by Dean Walters.”

“And the Saudis save a few bucks. I’m sure they were paying those engineers a lot more than twenty-five dollars a day. You’re a moron Donaldson. By the way, who here is awaiting a memory upgrade on their laptop?” The wide-eyed young woman raised her hand. “Step into my office…”

White strode to his cart, pulled the laptop out and handed it to her. “Now, go forth and do great things.”

“I’m not through with you, White. I’m going straight to Dean Walters…”

“Please do. And ask her to visit me in that dungeon they call a repair shop. I’ll be happy to fill her in on the details of this little project of yours. And…” White invoked air quotes: “ ‘for the love of Mike,’ bring those boys home before they torch the entire east coast of Egypt.”

White wheeled his cart down the hall to his next delivery.
