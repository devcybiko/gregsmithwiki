# Chapter 4 - first students

White glared at the stack of resumes on his desk - a sampling of Rensselaer Polytechnic's discards. He hated Bell for giving him this task. Somehow he had to pick three imbeciles from this lot who would be competent enough - and in some way worthy enough - to run Bell's computer forensics lab.

He leaned back in his chair and it creaked under his weight. He reflected on the space around him that Ludd had cobbled together. It was a spare set of cubicles on the first floor of the Turing building - and White sat alone in the center of it.

The Turing building had four floors. It was an abandoned hotel before the university purchased Starbuck Island. For decades prior, the island had been home to various incarnations of manufacturing. Automobile, railroad, and steel manufacturing had all taken a turn on Starbuck. And it had gone by many names: Green Island, Tibbits, Rensselaerswyck, and _Pachanhanit_ by the indigenous peoples before the settlers arrived. During Edison's time it was so important as a manufacturing hub that they built the Green Island power plant to run the assembly lines. Now, that power plant made Starbuck University a self-sufficient mini-city.

At the center of it all was the Manor of Rensselaerswyck: a sprawling series of buildings that made up a mansion of sorts for it's owner Kiliaen van Rensselaer. Rensselaer acquired the island in 1630 from the Dutch West India Company and immediately built his namesake. The Turing building was all that was left of the manor and itself had gone through many incarnations, ultimately ending up a brothel and hotel before it was shut down in the 1960s. It was a bona-fide historical site and the University was obligated to keep it up, despite the fact that all concerned would have preferred to demolish it in favor of a more modern edifice.

These facts played in White's subconscious as he scowled at the stack. _It's the beginning that's the hardest,_ he thought. He had contemplated many ways to attack the problem: he could just take the top three resumes and throw the rest away. What did he care which of these kids were going to run this shop? Or, he could throw all of them into the air and pluck three before they fell to the floor. That'd be as random a selection as any. 

In the end, however, what he really wanted to do was annoy the hell out of Bell. So he began by peeling the first CV off the stack, determined to find the three candidates who would make Bell wish he had picked someone else to staff his forensics lab. _The Minimax Method,_ he thought: _minimize the cost to you, maximize the cost to your opponent._

## Willow

The task was much easier than White had imagined. Weeding out the uninteresting resumes went quickly. None of the candidates seemed particularly noteworthy (aka: irksome). Some had started in business school and moved into computing because it seemed the best way to make the most money. Some were foreign-born students who came to America to cap off their educations with a degree from a highly accredited university - nothing unique there. Others appeared to be silver-spoons who didn't care about computing and just wanted to satisfy daddy.

As much as he wanted to give Bell the shaft, he simply couldn't pick unqualified candidates. He had a certain amount of pride and wouldn't purposely do a bad job. He didn't want to sabotage Bell - just give him a little friction. So, he was looking for smart, yet oddball kids. _Minimax, yes?_

Here was one who claimed their masters thesis was based on _contemplative algorithms._ White was well-versed and well-read in computer science. He had access to the University's library, internet, and academic journals. He kept up on all the latest research and had never heard of contemplative algorithms. The resume showed the candidate's name as simply "Willow." His interest was piqued and he determined to have a look-see.

Despite Ludd's apparent technical illiteracy, he was at least an efficient administrator. The local area network and WiFi were active. He pulled his laptop out of his backpack and logged in. White found Willow's thesis on Rensselaer's website and he began a deep dive.

It was an entertaining read. There was a fair amount of technical detail, and well written at that. But all throughout were references to the _the ether_ and _gaia_ and _introspection_ - none of which belonged in a scholarly paper on computing. When he downloaded the source code for the associated app, White was genuinely surprised. The code was very, very good.  He hadn't expected to find that a new age air head had written anything technically innovative. At the heart of it all was one algorithm Willow claimed improved their app's performance from 10 to 100 percent. It was called, simply, _omm_.

_Omm_ wasn't particularly interesting, except for what it wasn't: it wasn't very long. It was literally a couple of nested loops that did nothing but traverse the internal memory of the app and randomly read memory locations. And nothing more. It didn't write them anywhere. It didn't do any calculations. It simply read all the values - and returned. Depending on the input values, the amount of time spent could be very little, or very long. In essence it did nothing of value, except - quite literally - contemplate the computer's navel.

White stowed this resume in his backpack.
