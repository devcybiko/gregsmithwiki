# Chapter 4 - first student

White glared at the stack of resumes on his desk. Ludd had fashioned a set of cubicles on the first floor of the Turing building and White sat alone in the space.

The Turing building had four floors. It had been a hotel in its earlier incarnation, before Starbuck Island had been purchased by the university. The island had been home to various incarnations of manufacturing in the decades prior. Automobile, railroad, and steel manufacturing had all taken a turn on Starbuck. And it had gone by many names: Green Island, Tibbits, Rensselaerswyck, and _Pachanhanit_ by the indigenous peoples before the settlers arrived. During Edison's time it was so important as a manufacturing hub that they built the Green Island power plant on the island. Now, that power plant make Starbuck University a self-sufficient mini-city.

And at the center of it all was the Manor of Rensselaerswyck: a sprawling series of buildings that made up a mansion of sorts for it's owner Kiliaen van Rensselaer who acquired the island in 1630 from the Dutch West India Company and immediately built his namesake. The Turing building was all that was left of the manor and itself had gone through many incarnations ultimately ending up a hotel and brothel before it was shut down in the 1960s.

These facts played in White's subconscious as he scowled at the stack. _It's the beginning that's the hardest,_ he thought. He had contemplated many ways to attack the problem: he could just take the top three resumes and throw the rest away. What did he care which of these kids were going to run this shop? Or, he could throw all of them into the air and pick three out of the air before they fell to the floor. That'd be as random a selection as any. 

In the end, however, what he really wanted to do was annoy the hell out of Bell. So he peeled the first CV off the stack and determined to find the three candidates who would make Bell wish he had picked someone else to staff his forensics lab. _The Minimax Method,_ he thought: _minimize the cost to you, maximize the cost to your opponent._

It was much easier than he imagined. None of the candidates seemed particularly interesting (aka: irksome). Some had started in business school and moved into computing because it seemed the best way to make the most money. Some were foreign-born students who came to America to cap off their educations with a degree from a highly accredited university. Others appeared to be silver-spoons who didn't care about the work and just wanted to satisfy daddy.

As much as he wanted to give Bell the shaft, he still couldn't pick unqualified candidates. He had a certain amount of pride and couldn't purposely do a bad job.
