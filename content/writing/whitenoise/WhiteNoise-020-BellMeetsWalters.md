# Chapter 2 - Bell

James Bell entered Janine Walters’ office and immediately realized how cold the room was. Not just in terms of the temperature, but the room was sparsely populated with furniture and not a single wall hanging. Walters herself sat behind a large black desk with her back to a bay window that looked out on Starbuck Island which was itself covered with snow.

“Please sit, Dr. Bell,” she said without looking up.

“Please, call me Jim,” Bell said as he sat in a wireframe armchair directly in front of her desk.

He sat there several minutes while Walters split her attention between a computer screen and some papers on her desk. Occasionally, she’d tap on the keyboard and make a mark on the papers. Presently, she looked up.

“Dr. Bell,” she began, “I’ve invited you to SBU today because I need to discuss your position here. I wanted to thank you in person for accepting our offer.”

Bell wondered about this abbreviation for Starbuck University. There already was a Stonybrook University in New York state that went by SBU. And then there was Southwest Baptist University and St. Bonaventure University as well. On top of that, naming a new university “Starbuck” was questionable. There were jokes floating within the community that a BS degree from Starbuck U. was less a Bachelor of Science and more a Barista of Snow. Considering SBU was built on an island just down the hill from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute - a venerable engineering school - comparisons would be inevitable. Other universities had taken to calling Starbuck “Harvard on the Hudson.”

“It’s my pleasure. Helping to build a new PhD program at a young university is a rare opportunity. What’s on your mind?”

“We need you to start right away. The program you’ve been hired to build has taken on a higher priority and we can’t wait for you to start in the fall. Will you be ready to start in the new year?”

Bell shifted in his seat under Walters’ spectacled gaze. “That’s rather a big change. Thanksgiving is just a couple weeks away. Can you say why the sudden urgency?”

Walters removed her glasses. “Yes, well, matters have changed somewhat. We have decided we need a computer forensics lab and we need it in place by the beginning of the spring semester, next April. Along with your charter to build our PhD program, we need you to staff the CFL and have it running before the new school year. Will you be able to start in January?”

Just then, there was a tepid knock at the door and Walters called out “Come!”

A short, stocky, balding man entered and said, “You sent for me Dr. Walters?”

“Yes, I was just talking to our newest faculty member here, Dr. Bell. He’ll be heading up the new PhD program.”

“Ah, welcome Bell. My name is Charles Ludd. I’m the director of facilities.”

Ludd moved to cross the room to shake hands when Walters lifted a finger and Ludd froze.

“Dr. Ludd, Dr. Bell will need a facility for the new CFL we discussed,” Walters explained.

“CFL? I don’t recall…”

Walters shot Ludd a look that Bell interpreted as extreme impatience. He knew he did not want to be on the receiving end of that look. “Yes. The Computer Forensics Lab. We discussed it at the last staff meeting. Did you pick out a location for it?”

“Ah. Yes. Well… um... space is quite limited as you know. The only building that isn’t in use is the old Turing building. It will need some work, but I think it will be satisfactory for both facilities and dormitory lodging for the students.”

Bell was instantly interested. “Turing, as in Alan Turing? That’s quite a fitting name for a forensics lab.”

Ludd turned his attention to Bell. “Oh… um… yes. The building was left behind when the old oil refinery closed down. It’s actually an official historic landmark here in Troy. So, we can update it, but we can’t tear it down. It’s been a bit of a nuisance, actually, so we put the computer repair facility in the basement. By the way, what is a forensics lab?”

Bell glanced at Walters who gave him the nod to explain. 

“Forensics is the study of criminal evidence. In our case I’ve been asked to create a computer forensics lab – or CFL. Most such labs are given computers or phones from crime scenes and asked to break their password protections and read any encrypted files. Very often these devices are found in the homes or offices of suspected criminals and exploiting their data can lead to a conviction.”

Ludd seemed to be thinking inwardly. “So, you’ll be dissecting computers? That sounds oddly biological. Will there be any special requirements?”

Bell raised an eyebrow at Walters who did not return his surprise. “Um… not exactly biological. Aside from wiring for computers – electricity, broadband and WiFi networking, we’ll need the usual office space adornments: meeting rooms, whiteboards, projectors, and a video conferencing room.”

Ludd gave a shrug. “That sounds fairly straightforward. So, if there are no other requirements, I’ll start the paperwork rolling. Is there anything else Dean Walters?”

“No, Ludd. That will be all. Thank you.”

Charles Ludd backed out of the room and closed the door behind him.

Bell thought only a moment before asking his next question: “That guy has a PhD? In what?”

“Administration. Don’t judge him too harshly, Bell. He’s not the most technical person you’ll meet, but he does keep this place running smoothly. Now, back to cases. Will you be able to start in January?”

Bell pushed his own glasses back up the bridge of his nose. “Well, my wife and I haven’t sold our home yet. But I’m not otherwise engaged. Let me see if she’s sent me anything.”

Bell quickly checked his phone for any new messages from his wife. Strangely, he had zero bars and no WiFi connection. He wrinkled his brow a bit and returned his attention to Walters.

 “My last position ended last month, so I’m able to start whenever you like. But starting up a department is a lot of work on its own. I’ll need help building a lab on top of that. It will mean picking a director and then students who might support the work.”

“Yes, yes. Well that’s your problem. We have several students we’ve recruited from RPI’s graduate program you can vet. And you can pick your own director. I’d like you to interview the faculty and pick a director from them and staff the CFL with your PhD students. Are we good to go?”

Bell looked at Walters evenly trying to decide if this was a rhetorical question. “Yes, I suppose so. I think I have someone in mind for the CFL, actually. I’ll work out the personal details with my wife and get back to you. What prompted the sudden need for this forensics lab?”

Walters waived her hand dismissively. “Well, Rensselaer has had a CFL for many years. They have handled some high-profile federal cases. The board decided we need to be competitive with them. So, we’ve made an arrangement with the state police department to create a sort of teaching lab where they bring us their cases and we use student time to do the analysis. The police are overtasked as it is, and we need the recognition. It’s a win-win.”

Bell kept his face passive. It was strange for a university to add a department without more planning. And the amount of work necessary building the lab could impact his own success with the PhD program. As much as he wanted this job, he didn’t like the last minute “scope creep.” It had a bad feel to it.

“Of course, I am sure I can manage it,” was all Bell said.

“Good. I’ll send you my notes along with the candidates by email. Thank you for dropping in.”

With a thin grin, she returned to her computing and Bell realized that the meeting was over. He stood up and walked to the door. As his hand touched the doorknob Walters called out.

“Oh, one more thing. We have a data leak. I’ll send the details to you in a separate email. I’ll need you to resolve that as soon as possible. It can be a test case for your new team and the CFL.”

Bell froze in his tracks.

“You consider a data leak an ‘oh, one more thing,’ conversation? You do realize the impact university data in the public domain could have? Passwords, social security numbers, even student private information in the wild would give us a very bad reputation and could damage people’s finances. This is quite serious.”

Walters looked over her glasses at Bell. “Why yes, Dr. Bell, I’m quite aware. It should be no problem for you and the CFL. It’s a small leak and the details will be in your inbox in a few minutes. Carry on.”

Bell opened his mouth for a moment as if to argue but remembered the look she gave Ludd. “Thank you, Dr. Walters. I’ll look for your notes in my email.” And this time he didn’t pause as he reached for the doorknob and left Janine Walters’ office.
