# Writing

I discovered I had a talent for writing in middle school. I had written a science fiction short story about a team that had built a rocket that travelled fast than the speed of light and crashed back on Earth 5 minutes before the takeoff, destroying the Earth. The lone survivor witnessed his ship taking of over and over for eternity.

However, the next year I discovered computers, and I was hooked. It would be nearly 30 years before I returned to writing and created the Agile Writer Method.
