# Computing

I've been programming computers since 1974, and I was an electronics enthusiast staring in 1970. Since I entered the age of computing at the beginning of the microprocessor revolution, I had to learn both the "old school" (mainframe), "current school" (mini-computers), and "new school" (microcomputers). I cut my teeth on BASIC, FORTRAN, COBOL, and Machine Languages of different types.

When I was 5 years old I wanted to be an astronaut. By the time I was 10 I wanted to be Thomas Edison. And by the age of 15 (1977) I knew I wanted to work with computers. When it came time to apply for college in 1981, I had to choose between Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. I took out all the circuits I had built that summer (6-7) and all the programs I had written (20+ cassette tapes) and realized software was my passion and I was accepted into the Computer Science curriculum at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (Troy, NY) - which was a devision of the math department at the time.

This is a test.
