# Scott Allison

[Scott Allison](https://psychology.richmond.edu/faculty/sallison/) has been a good friend since 2005 when we were both inducted in the ComedySportz Richmond "affirmative action" program (we were significantly older than most players).  When I left CSz after 5 years I started the Agile Writer Workshop where I used the Hero's Journey to help beginning writers create a first-draft novel in 6 months. I stumbled upon Scott's first book on heroes [Heroes: What They Do and Why We Need Them](https://www.amazon.com/Heroes-What-They-Need-Them/dp/0199739749/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8). When we discovered we had another mutual interest, we started the [Reel Heroes](http://reelheroes.net) movie review blog in 2013. Since then we've published two books on heroes in the movies ([Reel Heroes: Volume 1 and Reel Heroes & Villains](https://reelheroes.net/about-our-book/))

Here are some of Scott's works that have influence my study of heroes and villains
